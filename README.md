# Ra-225-Oven

Radium 225 oven printed out of DMLS Ti64 alloy.

The assembly allows for independent control of 4 oven tubes. Each tube can be filled with a seperate isotope/element. Each tube has its own pin on the flange but shares a common ground. 

# Dimensions:
  Height: 2.8cm not including flange and sockets. (Assembly rests 3.25cm above the flange pins.)
  
  Length: 2.8cm.
  
  Width: 0.7cm.
  

# Operating Temperature:
We can run a maximum of 10 amps through each tube. The max current is limited by the flange rating (power supplies can run 10.6 amps). Based on the red glow of the titanium tube, we know that the oven reaches temperatures of at least 500 C. The oven begins to glow around 7 amps, 20 watts. The oven can be run consistently at 10 amps, ~34 watts. My uninformed estimate is that the temperature at max current is somewhere around 800C.

Thermocouple?

# Chemistry:
Already Tested: Grains of Ca and powdered SrCl2, grains of Ca and 0.1M SrCl2 solution.

Confusing- Ca reacted with H20 from the 0.1M SrCl2 solution and presumably formed Ca(OH)2. The oven still worked. What is going on here??? It is important to figure this out because we want to know if we can put the reducing agent in the tube before the Th solution evaporates.

Need to test: Trace amounts of Ca and SrCl2. 

Do we want to test a different reducing agent? What is the best way to get trace amounts of SrCl2- super diluted solution?

# Left to do:
Test trace amounts of SrCl2
