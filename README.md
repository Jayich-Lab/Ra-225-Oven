# Ra225 Oven

Our Radium 224, 225, and 226 oven is DMLS printed out of Ti-6Al-4V alloy.

The oven design allows for independent control of 4 oven tubes. Each oven tube can be filled with a seperate isotope/element. Each tube has its own pin on the flange. All 4 tubes share a common ground.

### Dimensions:
  Height: 2.8cm (Not including flange and sockets. The assembly rests 3.25cm above the flange pins.)
  
  Length: 2.8cm.
  
  Width: 0.7cm.
  
  Tube Volume: 3uL.
  

### Operating Temperature:
We can run a maximum of 10 amps through each tube. The current is limited by the maximum operating current of the flange. We know that the oven reaches temperatures of at least 500 C because we observe that the oven tubes begin to glow incandescently around 7 amps, 20 watts. The oven can be run consistently at 10 amps, ~34 watts.

### Chemistry:
Already Tested: Grains of Ca and powdered SrCl2, grains of Ca and 0.1M SrCl2 solution. Trace amounts of Ca and SrCl2. 

Not Yet Tested: Ra226 and Zirconium, Ra225 and Zirconium, Ra224 and Zirconium. BaCO3 may also be added to act as a reducing agent.

Note: Ra226, Ra225, and Ra224 are sourced from the alpha decays of Th230, Th229, and Th228 respectively.
