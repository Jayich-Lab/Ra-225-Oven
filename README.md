# Ra-225-Oven

The Radium 224,225,and 226 oven is DMLS printed out of Ti-6Al-4V alloy.

The oven design allows for independent control of 4 oven tubes. Each oven tube can be filled with a seperate isotope/element. Each tube has its own pin on the flange. All 4 tubes share a common ground.

# Dimensions:
  Height: 2.8cm (Not including flange and sockets. The assembly rests 3.25cm above the flange pins.)
  
  Length: 2.8cm.
  
  Width: 0.7cm.
  
  Tube Volume: 3uL.
  

# Operating Temperature:
We can run a maximum of 10 amps through each tube. The current is limited by the maximum operating current of the flange. We know that the oven reaches temperatures of at least 500 C. The tubes begin to glow incandescently around 7 amps, 20 watts. The oven can be run consistently at 10 amps, ~34 watts. My uninformed estimate is that the temperature at max current is somewhere around 800C.

# Chemistry:
Already Tested: Grains of Ca and powdered SrCl2, grains of Ca and 0.1M SrCl2 solution. Trace amounts of Ca and SrCl2. 



Do we want to test a different reducing agent? What is the best way to get trace amounts of SrCl2- super diluted solution?
