# Ra225 Oven
This project is in active development.

Our oven is designed for Radium isotopes 224, 225, and 226. The oven is 3D printed out of Ti-6Al-4V alloy using Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS).

The oven design allows for independent control of 4 oven tubes. Each oven tube can be filled with a seperate isotope/element. Each tube has its own pin on the flange. All 4 tubes share a common ground.

### Dimensions V1 Oven (pictured):
  Assembly Height: 28mm. (Including gold sockets, the assembly rests 32.5mm above the flange pins.)
  
  Assembly Length: 28mm.
  
  Assembly Width: 7mm.
  
  Individual Tube Volume: 3uL.
  
  Tube Outer Diameter: 1.5mm.
  
  Tube Inner Diameter: 0.75mm.
  
  Tube Depth: 7mm.
  
### Dimensions V2 Oven:
  Assembly Height: 37mm. (Including gold sockets, the assembly rests 41.5mm above the flange pins.)
  
  Assembly Length: 31mm.
  
  Assembly Width: 8.5mm.
  
  Individual Tube Volume: 10.75uL.
  
  Tube Outer Diameter: 2.2mm.
  
  Tube Inner Diameter: 1.4mm.
  
  Tube Depth: 7mm.
  
### Operating Temperature:
We can run a maximum of 10 amps, limited by the maximum operating current of the flange, through each tube. We know that the oven reaches temperatures of at least 500 C because we observe that the oven tubes begin to glow incandescently around 7 amps, 20 watts. The oven can be run consistently at 10 amps, ~34 watts.

### Chemistry:

Oven tubes are filled using a Hamilton brand syringe. 2 ÂµL, Model 7102 KH SYR, Knurled Hub NDL, 23 ga, 2.75 in, point style 3, Catalog number: 88500

Already Tested: Grains of Ca and powdered SrCl2, grains of Ca and 0.1M SrCl2 solution, trace amounts of Ca and SrCl2. 

Not Yet Tested: Ra226 and Zirconium, Ra225 and Zirconium, Ra224 and Zirconium. BaCO3 may also be added as a reducing agent.

Note: Ra226, Ra225, and Ra224 are sourced from the alpha decays of Th230, Th229, and Th228 respectively.
