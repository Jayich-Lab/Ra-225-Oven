# Ra-225 Oven
This project is under active development. We are designing an orthotropic oven to be tested alongside the oven documented below. 

Our oven is designed to provide a atomic flux of radium isotopes 224, 225, and 226 that we can use to load our ion traps. We test the oven with analog elements such as strontium and barium. The oven is 3D printed out of Ti-6Al-4V alloy using Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS).

The oven design allows for independent control of 4 oven tubes. Each oven tube can be filled with a seperate isotope/element. Each tube has its own pin on the flange. All 4 tubes share a common ground.

### Dimensions V1 Oven (pictured):
  Assembly Height: 28mm. (Including gold sockets, the assembly rests 32.5mm above the flange pins.)
  
  Assembly Length: 28mm.
  
  Assembly Width: 7mm.
  
  Individual Tube Volume: 3uL.
  
  Tube Outer Diameter: 1.5mm.
  
  Tube Inner Diameter: 0.75mm.
  
  Tube Depth: 7mm.
  
### Dimensions V2 Oven:
  Assembly Height: 37mm. (Including gold sockets, the assembly rests 41.5mm above the flange pins.)
  
  Assembly Length: 31mm.
  
  Assembly Width: 8.5mm.
  
  Individual Tube Volume: 10.75uL.
  
  Tube Outer Diameter: 2.2mm.
  
  Tube Inner Diameter: 1.4mm.
  
  Tube Depth: 7mm.
  
### Operating Temperature:
We can run each oven tube at a maximum of 15 amps (limited by the maximum operating current of the flange). We know that the oven reaches temperatures of at least 1000K when we run at 15A, 69W. 

### Chemistry:

Oven tubes are filled using a Hamilton brand syringe. 2 ÂµL, Model 7102 KH SYR, Knurled Hub NDL, 23 ga, 2.75 in, point style 3, Catalog number: 88500

Anolog tests: Grains of Ca and powdered SrCl2, grains of Ca and 0.1M SrCl2 solution, trace amounts of Ca and SrCl2. 

Radium tests: Ra226 and Zirconium, Ra225 and Zirconium, Ra224 and Zirconium. BaCO3 may also be added as a reducing agent.

Note: Ra226, Ra225, and Ra224 are sourced from the alpha decays of Th230, Th229, and Th228 respectively.
